# Strength-App
#The Strength App is developed in Python GUI tkinter. The purpose of the Strength App is to allow the user to open the application to calculate their 1 Rep Max and view the 1 Rep Max chart. The 1 Rep Max calculator will allow users to enter the training weight and repetitions, and then click calculate to see their 1 Rep Max. 

# For example: Training Weight: 135 ibs | Reptitions: 12 reps
# 1 Rep Max for lifting 135 ibs for 12 reps will be 189 kg
